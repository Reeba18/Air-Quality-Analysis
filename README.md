# Air-Quality-Analysis
Analysis of a dataset about air quality using Python

View this project on : https://mavenanalytics.io/project/9000

## Data
The data is sourced from Kaggle.
It consists of the following fields:

Timestamp : Time and date of observation (years included are 2018 to 2021)

PM 2.5 : Fine particulate matter which is a major cause of air pollution

Data was explored,cleaned,transformed and visualized to gain insights.

## Objective

Basically, the data is studied to find out the hour-wise,month-wise and year-wise average air pollution. On the basis of the PM 2.5 values, the air quality indexes are available in order to classify the air as good,moderate,unhealthy for sensitive groups,unhealthy,very unhealthy and hazardous.The following questions are then worked upon :

1. Show the Year-wise average pollution with a Line chart.
2. Draw the Area plot showing the average pollution per month.
3. Draw a Bar graph to show the hourly average pollution.
4. Usually in which month/s, the air was recorded 'Very Unhealthy'?
5. Usually in which month/s, the air was fresh(good)?
6. In year 2018, how many times the AQI was recorded as 'Moderate'?
7. How was the weather in the months of January and July?

## Results

Air pollution was maximum in year 2018 and minimum in 2020

July and August have the least air pollution

Air pollution is high during the time period of 3 am-6am and 5pm-8pm

Air was very unhealthy in the month of November while it is fresh in August

Air was unhealthy in January and moderate in July

Air quality was recorded as moderate 2239 times in the year 2018
